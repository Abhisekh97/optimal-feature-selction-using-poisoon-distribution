# optimal-feature-selction-using-poisoon-distribution
in sentiment analysis there are various method by which we can select the optimal feature like gini index, information gain etc. But in binary classification problem we can use another method i.e Poisson distribution which reduces computation required by reducing features of the training dataset and keeping only those features which contribute more in predicting value.
here testcode.py file is the important one where the poisson distribution code is written
rest of the files simply machine learning algorithms are applied 
you can test the accuracy yourself
